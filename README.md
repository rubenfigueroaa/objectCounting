# objectCounting

v0.3. This repository will be separated, since I am also working on Cv2 and mediapipe with python, plus more advanced algorithms inside Matlab for specific image processing techniques, it will have two folders mainly, one for Python, with more Real Time Tracking Techniques, and MATLAB, for more advanced image processing algorithms
v0.2 Based on Murtaza's Workshop, the object counting transitions to Real Time Tracking Systems using Python via Pycharm IDE. The libraries needed are cv2, cvzone and numpy. This iteration provides a groundwork for computer vision algorithms and their accurate processing in real time. Major documentation relies on sliders for the threshold and minArea contour, as well as improving camera equipment due to blurriness.
Here is a result with 6 coins:

Object Counting using Image Processing Toolbox
V0.0 Counting of separated objects using Connected Components (bwconncomp)

Newest Iteration
Object Counting 


V0.1 Object Counting of Overlapped Objects using same Algorithm + Distance Transform and Watershed Segmentation. Validated functionality in before images.

This edition of the algorithm processes an image with 20 coins.

The algorithm is explained briefly in the next flow diagram, where the rectangles in orange represent the added commands for overlapped objects.

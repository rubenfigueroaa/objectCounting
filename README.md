Object Counting using Image Processing Toolbox
V0.0 Counting of separated objects using Connected Components (bwconncomp)

Newest Iteration
Object Counting 
V0.1 Object Counting of Overlapped Objects using same Algorithm + Distance Transform and Watershed Segmentation. Validated functionality in before images.

This edition of the algorithm processes an image with 20 coins.

The algorithm is explained briefly in the next flow diagram, where the rectangles in orange represent the added commands for overlapped objects.
